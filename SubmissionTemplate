Problem Statement


(background and applications, do not copy from paper, use your own words to summarize,
figures can be added to better explain the problem)

<span style="color:red;">We choose whatever paper and summarize the background and the applications already applied by our solution? Why does it work here?</span>


Problem Solution from Previous Work
(use your own words to summarize)
Proposed Idea
Comparison between Proposed Algorithm and Existing Ones
(Show figures of the comparison between your work and existing ones. X-axis and Y-axis must
be clear. At least 3 figures need to be included. Describe each figure and explain why your
proposed algorithm is better.)

```
  - We need Novely (What makes it different, What makes it better?)
  - Visualize its performance in a figure to showcase the linear progression between the two
  - ensure we use concise and discrete X and Y format
```
Conclusion (self-explanatory)
References:
[1] github link
[2] paper you use (use same format as the references in standard journals), paper must be
within 5 recent years (2021-2025).
